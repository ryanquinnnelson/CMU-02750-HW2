    "# 1.0. Part 0. (15 points)\n",
    "**First, read the paper and answer the following questions.**\n",
    "### 1. What is the idea behind the ZLG algorithm (5 points)?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Version\n",
    "ZLG is a Type II active learning algorithm used for binary classification on a pool-based data access model. It \n",
    "labels instances based on expected risk, and it comes with no guarantees of performance or label complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by building a weighted graph over a pool of labeled and unlabeled instances, with edges connecting \n",
    "instances which are deemed \"similar enough.\" ZLG uses the graph and known labels to construct a probability \n",
    "distribution over the unlabeled instances. It finds the optimal labeling solution for the distribution in closed-form,\n",
    "producing label predictions for all unlabeled instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "ZLG uses these predictions to calculate the expected risk of inferring labels for all unlabeled instances.\n",
    "The algorithm searches through the unlabeled \n",
    "instances to find the one which, when labeled, reduces the expected risk the most. ZLG queries the label for this instance and updates label\n",
    "predictions for all unlabeled instances based on the label. This search process is \n",
    "repeated until a defined stopping point, at which point we use the current label predictions to label all unlabeled \n",
    "instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Informal Version\n",
    "*In layman's terms, ZLG starts with the idea that if we assume data has natural clusters, we can also assume that \n",
    "two data points which are close together are likely to have the same label. Under this theory, labeled instances \n",
    "surrounding an unlabeled instance \"influence\" what the label ought to be, with the amount of influence depending on \n",
    "how similar a labeled instance is to the unlabeled one.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*ZLG models this influence as a system of energy, with each data point radiating energy outward onto all of its \n",
    "neighbors. Data points with similar labels \"vibrate\" at similar wavelengths, creating resonance; data points \n",
    "with different labels vibrate at different wavelengths, creating dissonance. By considering the energies of all \n",
    "of the points, we can determine the energy of the overall system. ZLG leverages the well-studied principles of a system of energy (Boltzmann distribution) to efficiently estimate a \n",
    "labeling which produces a system with the least energy (i.e. least dissonance), given the current set of labeled instances. The estimates represents what the labels should be when considered as a system of energy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given that this is an estimate, there is some risk that the predicted labels are wrong. Until its query budget is used up, ZLG repeatedly searches for the best instances to query to minimize this risk, updating its predictions along the way.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are the assumptions behind the ZLG algorithm (5 points)?\n",
    "- ZLG assumes that a Radial Basis Function provides a good measurement of the similarity between data points.\n",
    "- ZLG assumes that the labels follow a Boltzmann distribution\n",
    "- ZLG assumes that inferred labelings, given the labeled data, follow a Multivariate Gaussian distribution\n",
    "- ZLG assumes that expected risk is the best strategy for selecting points to label\n",
    "- ZLG assumes that all of the features have equal importance when calculating similarity\n",
    "- ZLG assumes we have a pool of data.\n",
    "- ZLG assumes we have binary labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are the pros and cons of the ZLG algorithm (5 points)?\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "- ZLG allows for very efficient label estimates and decisions for which points to label.\n",
    "- ZLG uses well-known techniques like the Laplacian matrix, which helps with comprehension of the algorithm and what it is doing.\n",
    "- ZLG uses expected risk as the query selection strategy, which is a more rigorous method than uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "- ZLG does not come with performance or label complexity guarantees.\n",
    "- ZLG makes a number of assumptions about the relationship of the labels to the data points, for mathematical convenience. If those assumptions do not hold, then the model may not perform well.\n",
    "- A lot of importance is put on accurately representing the similarity of two data points. If certain features of data points are more important than others, ZLG does not take this into account when calculating weights. This could lead to a less performant model overall.\n"
